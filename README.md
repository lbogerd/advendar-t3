# Advendar

Make online advent calendars for your friends and loved ones. A full-stack TypeScript NextJS application using (amongst others) tRPC, shadcn/ui, NextAuth, and Drizzle ORM. The project has been initialized with `create-t3-app`.

## The Idea

Last year I wanted to create a simple online advent calendar for my partner. My search for exisiting solutions did not yield any usable results so I made a one-off version. I now want to enable people to easily build one themselves without having to have any programming or design skills. Advendar is my attempt at building such a product.

## Current Status
The project is in very early development. As I mostly use this to practice/play with new technologies there is currently nothing resembling a road map though I plan to have a simple version online well before the 2024 holiday season.
